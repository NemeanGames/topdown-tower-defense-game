# Topdown Tower Defense Game

This project is a hybrid tower‑defense and top‑down shooter web game built with the AGENT_BOOTSTRAP v4.1 orchestrator. It features dynamic A* pathing, editable build tiles, core objective, towers, and player‑controlled shooting.

## Features

- **Build Phase:** Place and upgrade towers on open tiles, respecting pathing rules that ensure enemies can reach the core.
- **Combat Phase:** Control a top‑down shooter character with WASD movement and mouse aiming. Shoot various weapons and deploy equipment alongside towers.
- **Dynamic Pathfinding:** Enemies navigate using A*; path recalculates when towers are placed.
- **Economy:** Earn money and experience from defeating enemies to buy towers, weapons, and perks.
- **Progression:** Unlock perks, equipment, and tower upgrades through experience.
- **Multiple Maps:** Support for different grid layouts with fixed walls and cores.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies and run the development server (setup will be generated by the orchestrator).
3. Open the local server in a browser to play.

## Development

This repository uses the AGENT_BOOTSTRAP v4.1 orchestrator to generate and coordinate the codebase. The orchestrator defines parallel packets for design, data, core, UI, economy, state, QA, and deployment tasks. After running the orchestrator start prompt, agents will produce code and tests which will be merged automatically when gates pass.

## License

This project will include an open‑source license file.
